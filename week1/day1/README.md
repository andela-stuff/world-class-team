## Goal for the day
* To give you an overview of what this program is about.

## Introduction
* *I introduce myself, plus one fun fact.*
* *Everyone introduces themselves, plus one fun fact about them.*
* *I give out my contact info* ([twitter](https://twitter.com/franklin_chieze), [github](https://github.com/Chieze-Franklin), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/franklinchieze/), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/franklin.chieze.5) ...), *ask them to like, follow, star, PR (even to add stuff they learn here that I didn’t implement in those projects)*

## Purpose of this program
* The purpose of this program is to introduce you to some best practices in software development.
* The hope is that with the application of these processes you can realize greater productivity in your team.
* With knowledge of these practices you are better equipped to work in world-class teams who also use similar practices.

## Method of operation
* Note that I will be facilitating, not teaching. YOYO (You Own Your Own, which basically means you are responsible for your own development)
* You have to pick an actual project (new or existing) on which we will carry out these practices. Similarly, the tools we will use (Slack, Github, Pivotal Tracker) should be real team assets.
* The team partaking in this exercise has to have a maximum of 7 team members
* We should meet about 3 times a week, usually Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
* Our focus will be on 2 key ingredients of world-class teams:
    * A software development methodology: Here we will use Agile.
    * A set of tools to help us carry out the tenets of the chosen software development methodology: Slack, Github, Pivotal Tracker, Heroku, Travis CI, Hound CI…

## Why should you trust this program?
* I have based this program on the programs that obtain at Andela.
* Andela has based her programs from feedback received from its world-class partners.

## Reflection
* General feedback
