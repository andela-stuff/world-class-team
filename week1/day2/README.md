## Goals for the day
* To introduce you to Agile in general, and Scrum in particular.

## Discussion
* Today's discussion is based on this article about [Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum).
* *This has to truly be a discussion, not a lecture*
* What is Scrum?
* What are the Scrum roles?
* What are the Scrum [Ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies)? 
* How can we get started with Scrum in a project? 
    * __Set up a Scrum team.__ I will be the Scrum Master. Who will be our Product Owner?
    * __Use tools that were built with Scrum in mind.__ For instance, [jira](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/how-to-do-scrum-with-jira-software). In this program, however, we will be using a tool called [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) to implement Scrum in our project.
    * __[Practice Scrum ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/ceremonies).__ 
        * *Describe a typical day at Andela: Improvs, Skill Session, TTL Interaction, Debrief*
        * We will create Slack channels for stand-ups, reflections where we will log daily stand-ups and reflections respectively.
        * We will set (recurring) time for product demo to the product owner, and code review with scrum master.
