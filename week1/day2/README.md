//talk about Agile that they read
// talk about how we will put agile to work in the project at hand: share roles (who will be TTL, PM,â€¦), standup (we will create a stand-ups slack channel, and use it every work day), TTL interaction, debriefs (create a channel for that)
// talk about morning improvs, and how distance will not allow us to practice it (why is it important?)
//talk about skill sessions, the team can decide to have this on their own
//take-home: create a channel for stand-ups and debriefs; read on Git
