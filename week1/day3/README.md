## Goals for the day
* To discuss some of the communication tools used by world-class teams.

## Discussion
* *Encourage the team to start using the stand-ups channel, even before there is a need to use it*
* Some of these tools are common place, and already being used by certain members of the team.

### Google Calendar

* __Uses__
> * You can set up a meeting on Google Calendar, going as far as to add a Google Hangout link, invite guests and choose room. *Demo this by creating an event on Andela's Calendar.*
> * You can create an appointment slot that other users can attach themselves to. Once again, this appointment slot can have a Google Hangout link.
> * Google Calendar helps teams that are globally-distributed to be able to *sync*. *Explain what syncing is.*
> * With Google Calendar you can see the calendar of a team member. This helps you decide an appropriate time to have a meeting/sync with that colleague.
