## Goals for the day
* To discuss some of the communication tools used by world-class teams.

## Discussion
* *Encourage the team to start using the stand-ups channel, even before there is a need to use it*
* Some of these tools are common place, and already being used by certain members of the team.

### Google Calendar
Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google.
* *Ensure everyone knows how to access their Google Calendar*
* __Uses__
> * You can set up a meeting on Google Calendar, going as far as to add a Google Hangout link, invite guests and choose room. *Demo this by creating an event on Andela's Calendar.*
> * You can create an appointment slot that other users can attach themselves to. Once again, this appointment slot can have a Google Hangout link.
> * Google Calendar helps teams that are globally-distributed to be able to *sync*. *Explain what syncing is.*
> * With Google Calendar you can see the calendar of a team member. This helps you decide an appropriate time to have a meeting/sync with that colleague.
> * Google Calendar shows you what rooms in your organization are available for booking within the time range of the meetiing for which you want to pick a room.

### Etiquette
* Do well to check people's calendar before scheduling a meeting/sync with them.
* When on a conference call, mute your mic when not speaking. This is especially useful when you have other people on the same conference call physically close to you (to reduce echos) or simply when you have distracting background noise.
