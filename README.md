# World-Class Team

This is a collection of sessions I hold with teams to help them become world-class.

A lot of us (teams and individuals) have a desire to be world-class but do not know how to go about that. 
That "how to" is what this program is about. There are a number of things to know before you can be on
your way to being world-class. This program focuses on 2 of them:  
* Software development methodologies (specifically [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/))
* Software development tools

During the course of the program I serve as the technical team lead of the team, helping the team member
develop the habit of using the methodologies and tools being touched.

Basically I take from what I have learnt from [Andela](https://andela.com/), and share them with teams.
My confidence in this program lies in the fact that the programs being run, the practices followed, 
and the tools used at Andela were chosen as a result of feedback from Andela partners, which happen to be
world-class companies.

### Notes
* Despite the fact that this program is targeted at teams, you can also utilize the knowledge here to set
yourself up for a smooth integration into a world-class team.
* This program does not teach you *how to code* (it is assumed you already know that). This program shows
you how to function effectively within a world-class team, even one that is globally-distributed.

Happy reading!
